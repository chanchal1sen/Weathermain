4.Challenges Faced During the development of the Weather App, one of the challenges encountered was ensuring a smooth integration with the OpenWeatherMap API. Handling asynchronous operations and managing API responses required careful consideration.

Additionally, achieving an attractive and responsive design posed challenges, especially when incorporating background animations and maintaining consistent styling across various screen sizes.
